# Catch-the-Fly
A simple Scratch game for my CS50 course
In this game, you control a frog using the left and right arrow keys. Flies fall from the top of the screen, and you have to catch them before they hit the ground. You earn one point for each fly you catch, which also increases both your and the fliesâ€™ moving speed. If you miss a fly, you lose one life. The game ends when you have no lives left.
